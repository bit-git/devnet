APIs Example
============

Open a Terminal window and run this example to see the response:
$ curl  https://deckofcardsapi.com/api/deck/new/

When you have Python installed in your terminal, you can get nicer formatted JSON 
by piping the output to the Python JSON tool like so:
$ curl https://deckofcardsapi.com/api/deck/new/ | python -m json.tool

You should see this response, which is a newly shuffled deck of cards with a unique ID, deck_id. Your deck_id value will be different from ft1bpglgquqr. You see that 52 cards remain in the deck and the deck remains unshuffled in the JSON response.

{
   "deck_id":"ft1bpglgquqr",
   "remaining":52,
   "success":true,
   "shuffled":false
}

You can shuffle that exact deck of cards with a request that contains the deck_id:
$ curl https://deckofcardsapi.com/api/deck/ft1bpglgquqr/shuffle/

Now the JSON response shows the deck has been shuffled by indicating true for "shuffled".

{
   "deck_id":"ft1bpglgquqr",
   "remaining":52,
   "success":true,
   "shuffled":true
}

With the freshly-shuffled deck, you can use the REST API to draw three cards by using 
a query parameter, ?count=3, on the draw resource like so. Remember to substitute your 
deck_id for ft1bpqlgquqr in the request URL.

$ curl https://deckofcardsapi.com/api/deck/ft1bpglgquqr/draw/?count=3 | python -m json.tool

WEBEX Teams
===========
Once you have signed up and logged in to the Cisco Webex for Developers site you 
can get your API token from the Authentication section on the Getting Started page.

Go to the API Reference > People > Get My Own Details to find your personId on that web page:

Now, open a Terminal window and run this example to send a "Hi from DevNet" message. 

Replace the toPersonEmail=someone@cisco.com with the email associated with your Webex Teams account, 
and put in your token value instead of MDg...zRh4:

$ curl https://webexapis.com/v1/messages -X POST -H "Authorization:Bearer MDg...zRh4" --data "toPersonEmail=someone@cisco.com" --data "text=Hi%20from%20DevNet"
